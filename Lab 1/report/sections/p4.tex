\section*{Problem 4}
The code listing for Problem 4, the \texttt{SPI\_write} function, is Listing~\ref{list:p4_spi_write}. The function is mostly a duplicate of the provided \texttt{SPI\_read} function. It changes the initialized sizes of \texttt{masterTxData} and \texttt{masterRxData} to always be 3 bytes as we are only writing 1 byte of data, and two additional bytes are required to select between READ or WRITE and to select the register address.

As outlined in the FXOS8700CQ documentation, we set the value of R/W to 1 for write. The order of bits for a write operation is as follows:\\
Byte 0: R/W,ADDR[6],ADDR[5],ADDR[4],ADDR[3],ADDR[2],ADDR[1],ADDR[0],\\
Byte 1: ADDR[7],X,X,X,X,X,X,X,\\
Byte 2: DATA[7],DATA[6],DATA[5],DATA[4],DATA[3],DATA[2],DATA[1],DATA[0].

The main function is shown below in Listing~\ref{list:p4_main}. We test our function with the PL\_COUNT register since it has 8 bits available for both read and write. The register is also available for both read and write during active mode. After the write, we read the value of the register by SPI and the register value changed as we wanted.
