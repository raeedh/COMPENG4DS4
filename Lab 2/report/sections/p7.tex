\section*{Problem 7}
The variable \texttt{rc\_values} contains a structure \texttt{RC\_Values}, which stores 9 2-byte integers, one integer for the header and eight integers for each of the eight data channel. This structure is used to store the data received via UART.

The variable \texttt{ptr} contains a pointer to the address of \texttt{rc\_values}, specifically the address to the first byte of \texttt{rc\_values}. When the main function is run and a stream of data is received via UART, the first byte is checked and stored in \texttt{ptr}, or the first byte of \texttt{rc\_values}. The value of this byte is checked to see if matches \texttt{0x20}, which is the first expected byte of data stream received. If this matches, the remaining 17 bytes are read via UART and stored at \texttt{\&ptr[1]}, which points to the address of the second byte of \texttt{header} in the structure.
