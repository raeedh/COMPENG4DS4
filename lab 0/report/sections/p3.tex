\section*{Problem 3}
The code listing for problem 3 is Listing~\ref{list:p3}. The \texttt{BOARD\_InitPins} function was updated to initialize the appropriate GPIO ports and pins (GPIOC 8 and 9 for blue and green, GPIOD 1 for red). The \texttt{GPIO\_PinInit} and \texttt{GPIO\_PortToggle} functions provided in the example were used to initialize the LEDs to an OFF state and for toggling the LEDs in the while loop.
